    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These carrot cookies are a Wetta family tradition; just ask my <a href="https://librarianstyle.com/2016/04/06/carrot-cookies/" target="_blank">sister</a>. 
        Originally from a Betty Crocker cookbook from the 70s, these were served at every family function growing up, usually from a wax-paper-lined shoebox my 
        grandmother had stored in the freezer. I do still prefer these frozen.</p>
    <p>These soft, decadent, cake-like cookies are divisive: you either love them or you hate them. The subtle carrot flavor is offset by the sharp tang of
        the orange frosting. Pro-tips: include extra orange zest and use carrot babyfood to save time.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the cookie dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cooked, mashed carrots (or baby food)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
        <li>juice and zest of one orange (or two for an extra kick)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
        <li>Cream together butter, sugar, eggs, and carrots in standing mixer. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add dry mixture to wet mixture until combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Scoop about two tablespoons of dough onto un-greased cookie sheet. Leave about two inches between cookies. Bake for 8 minutes until cookies are soft to the touch. Cool on rack.</li>
        <li>For frosting, cream together butter and powdered sugar in standing mixer. Add vanilla, orange juice, and zest. Beat until combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: you may have extra frosting. Save for later or make a double batch of cookies. They're that good, anyway.</p>
